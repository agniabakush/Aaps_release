     * The driver had declared [GetValue.Value.Alarms] since it was written without ever asking for
     * it, so until 2026-08-31 the record layout had never been seen. It is the second, independent
     * reading of an event the live status frame also reports, and one open question needed exactly
     * that: a captured
     * session has the pump putting a code in the status frame that does not decode to LowReservoir at
     * the moment the cartridge crossed the pump's own low level.
     *
     * That question now has an answer, and it is a stronger one than expected. The read of 2026-08-31
     * returned the pump's whole stored history - 66 records, 2026-05-05 to 2026-08-31 - and not one
     * of them is a low-reservoir alarm. What is there: 52 NoDelivery, 7 ButtonError, 4 DeadBattery
     * and 3 LowBattery. Through that whole window the pump was set to warn at 20 U and at two hours
     * of insulin left, and many cartridges were used up.
     *
     * So the pump does not put its low-reservoir warning where AAPS can see it, in the history or in
     * the live status slots, and the driver's own reservoir card is not a second opinion but the only
     * one there is. This does not prove the pump can never store such a record - the history is a
     * ring and the 52 NoDelivery records came in bursts that may have pushed older ones out - but it
     * does mean nothing may be built on the pump raising it.
     *
     * A read, not a command: nothing here changes pump state. `noOptimizations` so a pump that does
     * not answer this value costs a quiet failure instead of a teardown and a reconnect - failing
     * quietly is the whole contract of a diagnostic. The flag is set before the read, so one attempt
     * per service run is all this can ever cost, whether it works or not.
     *
     * It runs at the end of the connect, where the driver has already told the command queue it is
     * ready, so it holds the command lock in a window where an insulin command can arrive. That is
     * why it gives the pump only [ALARM_HISTORY_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT] to produce its FIRST record,
     * instead of the 30 s a history read normally gets: a pump that answers answers at once, and a

     * 10 s for a single value, 30 s for a history read, and on the connect path a failed read tears
     * the link down and starts the reconnect loop.
     *
     * A chunked read is NOT finished here - the frame only refreshes the "still arriving" timer, the
     * same way a good frame does, so the entries around a bad one are still collected. A single value
     * read has nothing left to wait for, so it is released at once with no response, which the caller
     * already handles as a failed read.

     *   a history read that is only empty slots is a pump with no history, not a failed read, and
     *   leaving the response null would make getBoluses() fail and onConnect() drop the link.
