     * Battery level to store for a StatusV1 frame.
     *
     * StatusV1 only carries the pump's own coarse gauge (`Dead`/`Low`/`Medium`/`High`/`Full` →
     * 0/25/50/75/100). On a pump that also sends StatusV2 the exact, voltage-derived percentage
     * arrives 1.5-2 s later, so writing the coarse value here made every reader show 100 % in
     * between. A Nightscout upload landing in that window published 100 % while the cell was really
     * at 66 % - measured on 2026-08-10: 32 of 1856 uploads over one day.
     *
     * So keep the level we already have while an exact one exists and is still recent. All three
     * conditions are needed:
     *  - [lastV2] is null on a 4.9/4.10 pump, which never sends StatusV2, and on every cold start
     *    before the first V2 frame arrives. Keeping the old level there would pin the display at
     *    the "no status yet" fallback of 0 %, which reads as a critical battery everywhere.
     *  - with [ApexBooleanKey.CalculateBatteryPercentage] off the calculated percentage is not
     *    wanted at all, and [updateFromV2] then just copies whatever StatusV1 wrote.
     *  - the age bound matters because a StatusV2 that stops answering is no longer treated as an
     *    error (see `ApexService.getStatus`). Without it the display would freeze at an
     *    exact-looking value while the cell actually drains. Falling back to the coarse gauge is
     *    the honest state, and it marks itself approximate.
     *
     * The whole previous [BatteryLevel] is carried, not only its percentage, because `approximate`
     * drives the display: rewriting it as approximate on every V1 frame would make the pump status
     * line flip between "66 % (1.40 V)" and "66 %" about once a minute.
     *
     * Kept, but capped. An incoming `Low` or `Dead` gauge is the pump's own verdict on the cell and
     * has to reach the display even while the held exact value is still fresh, because three callers
     * can leave a V1 frame as the only thing applied for a whole cycle: `ApexService.checkPump`
     * reads StatusV1 alone before a bolus or TBR, a StatusV2 that times out is a warning rather than
     * a failure, and `onStatusV1` publishes about 1.6 s before the V2 of its own cycle. Waiting for
     * the next V2 there kept publishing a healthy-looking percentage while the pump beeped
     * LowBattery. So `Dead` writes 0 and `Low` caps at 25; a stored value already below the cap is
     * left where it is.
     *
     * The cap deliberately does not touch `approximate`. It stays whatever the stored level had,
     * because `ApexService.onBatteryChanged` skips any comparison that mixes an exact reading with a
     * coarse one: a Low-capped 25 % flagged approximate, followed by a new cell at an exact 100 %,
     * is exactly that mixed pair, and the PUMP_BATTERY_CHANGE event would be dropped.
     *
     * Recovery after a stale `Dead` V1 has overwritten a good exact value is slow, and it is not
     * "the next V2": that V2 reads [lastV1], which is still Dead, so [capByGauge] pins what it
     * publishes back to 0 as well. Only [BatteryLevel.uncappedPercentage] moves there - the voltage
     * map itself is no longer zeroed by the gauge, which is what lets the swap detector still see a
     * new cell. It takes a non-Dead V1 - which keeps the stored 0 %, but moves [lastV1] - and then a V2,
     * about two minutes when both frames arrive in order. With no V2 at all,
     * [EXACT_BATTERY_MAX_AGE_MS] makes the exact value unusable and a V1 writes its coarse gauge
     * again. That pessimistic window is accepted: erring low on a cell the pump itself called Dead
